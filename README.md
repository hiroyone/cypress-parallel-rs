# rs-cypress-parallel

Inspired by [cypress-parallel](https://github.com/tnicola/cypress-parallel), but this app is written in Rust from scratch.

The app is aiming to be:

- less buggy and safer by the Rust langauge system
- more readable and extensible thanks to Rust types
- even faster than the cypress-parallel app
